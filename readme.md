# HOW TO USE MY TO-DO APP

So this is a basic to-do app using HTML, JS and Tailwind CSS v.4.0.7. and of course NODE.
Just clone the repository and then run in your console the following line to install all the packages from package.json:

```shell
npm install
```
then this one to build the project (run it as many times as you need to build it):

```shell
npm run build
```

 that'll make the trick because the script is already in package.json, if you want to look at it. Have fun!
